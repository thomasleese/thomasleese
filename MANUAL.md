# Manual for me

Hi, I’m Thomas, a software developer based in the UK working in the public sector.

## Working hours

I work 5 days a week, generally between 8am and 4pm, although I can be flexible according to the needs of the team.

I’m more of a morning person and find that I’m most productive at that time, so don’t be suprised if I’m already online and working before 8am.

Feel free to contact me at any time of the day, even outside my typical working hours. I use do not disturb and other features to avoid interruptions when focused on something in particular or out of hours, so I may not always reply immediately.

## Communication

I’ll use whatever tool is best for the team, whether that’s Microsoft Teams, Slack, etc. When getting in touch feel free to ask the question right away without waiting for me to reply, in case I’ve got notifications turned off, I’ll respond as soon as possible.

## Collaboration

I enjoy collaborative working, especially across different job roles, and I love to get involved in user research and design where I can and where it’s approriate.

I tend to learn by doing, so my instinct is to get stuck in to a problem right away to discovery the potential pitfalls and solutions, and then report back to the rest of team. I find it harder to think through problems in the abstract without having a concrete example or ideas to work from.
